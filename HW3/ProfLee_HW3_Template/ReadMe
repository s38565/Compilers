ss2.source: A Subset of the Lexical analyzer. You should be able to
            write a better one. (ss1.source is even simpler version.)

y2.y:        A very limited subset of C Grammar. You should add into the
            grammar or at least it show you how things work.


def.h:      A  definition file used by ss2.source


y.tab.h:    It's generated by "yacc -vd y.y". You shouldn't write this one.


code.c:     Symbol Table Handler

code.h:     Symbol table .h

test1.c:    A very simple program to test that the demo parser is parsing
            a testing program correctly.

test2.c:    Another simple program to test that the demo parser is parsing
            a testing program correctly.

test.s:     The partial result of the 80x86 assembly of the test file is
            generated in test.s


===================execution procedure===============

You can use the shell script "compiler_proj" as the makefile
or doing the following.


%lex ss2.source

%yacc -vd y2.y

%cc -c code.c

%cc lex.yy.c y.tab.c code.c -ll

%a.out test1.c  (or test2.c)


%more test.s
